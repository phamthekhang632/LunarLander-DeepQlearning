# Moon Landing using Deep Q-Learning
This is final project for MMAE500 - Data-Driven Modeling: an introduction to machine learning class.
<br/>
The project impliments Deep Q-learning to control the landing of a space shuttle in the [Lunar Lander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) environment from Farama-Foundation's Gymnasium (previously OpenAI's Gym).
